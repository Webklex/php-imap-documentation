## Features & pull requests
Everyone can contribute to this project. Every pull request will be considered but it can also happen to be declined.
To prevent unnecessary work, please consider to create a [feature issue](https://github.com/Webklex/php-imap/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
first, if you're planning to do bigger changes. Of course you can also create a new [feature issue](https://github.com/Webklex/php-imap/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
if you're just wishing a feature ;)

## A little notice
If you write source code in your issue, please consider to format it correctly. This makes it so much nicer to read
and people are more likely to comment and help :)

&#96;&#96;&#96;php<br />
echo 'your php code...';<br />
&#96;&#96;&#96;

will turn into:

```php
echo 'your php code...';
```
